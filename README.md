# Projects

**_Hey!_**

**My Name is Jeebula Bhaskar Saivinay and this is my projects repository.**

### Calculator

In this project, I've used Tkinter library as GUI for the calculator. As for the actual working, the string typed would be fetched by a function, which will then process the string to identify operator and numbers using regex (Regular Expressions). Then the typed operation would be carried out and answer would be displayed in text box. 

##### Remark

Only one operator can be used in the expression at a time, though it can be used multiple times but complex expressions currently will not be processed.


### Smart Parking System (DE)

This is a project We developed in team for Design Engineerng subject. Its a webserver application based in Django and python to get user info and place where the user wants to book the parking place and then the sensor in that place would be alerted. Also all the parking spots real time status would be visilble on the webserver it self. As this is a prototype, it shows dummy places with dummy data, a booking page which only has one sensor attached to it other for showing the working of booking.

For running the Django server, you'll have to install Django, Yagmail and Boltiot modules for no-error execution.

##### Remarks

This is still work in progress project and when deployed as local server will show the website which user will use to book the parking spot but sensor part would still need to be interfaced.

### Theatre Booking System (python_1)

This is a project im currently working on which can be explained in short as a working prototype of Book My Show type of software using Python, MySQL and Tkinter.
